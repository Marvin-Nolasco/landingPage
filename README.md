# E-commerce product page

![Design preview for the E-commerce product page coding challenge](./design/desktop-design.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

**To do this challenge, you need a good understanding of HTML, CSS/SASS and JavaScript.**

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this e-commerce product page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images
- Add items to the cart (the cart doesn't need to function, a simple visual indication is enough)

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find the desktop version of the design.

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`.

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

## Building your project

Feel free to use any workflow that you feel comfortable with. Below is a suggested process, but do not feel like you need to follow these steps:

1. Initialize your project as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/).
2. Before adding any styles, structure your content with HTML.
3. Start adding styles to the top of the page and work down. Only move on to the next section once you're happy you've completed the area you're working on.

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
